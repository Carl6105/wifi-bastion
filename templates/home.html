        Wi-Fi Bastion is a cutting-edge web-based application developed to safeguard users from potential cyber threats posed by malicious Wi-Fi networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        By scanning available Wi-Fi networks in real time, the app detects and identifies suspicious networks, such as those with weak or no encryption, or networks attempting to mimic legitimate hotspots through "Evil Twin" attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application uses advanced network scanning to analyze SSIDs, BSSIDs, encryption types, and signal strengths. It provides real-time alerts and empowers users to make informed decisions before connecting to any Wi-Fi network.
